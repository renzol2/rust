# wavetable synth

an exploration of basic wavetable synthesis in rust, using this article as a start: <https://www.thewolfsound.com/sound-synthesis/wavetable-synth-in-rust/>

some ideas on extending:

- allow switching of wavetables through CLI args
  - allow wavetable concatenation through CLI args
- allow programming of notes/frequencies and rhythms through CLI args
  - use crates to facilitate musical parameters
- add proper duration add ADSR envelope
- create design doc with set features and move to separate repository
